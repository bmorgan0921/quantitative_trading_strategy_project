    "\n",
    "The motivation behind exploring this strategy is to explore the investable opportunities in equities by analyzing their sentimental features. Quandl provided pre-computed sentiment features for equities that were easily accessible to analyze. Additionally, we wanted to explore basic machine learning algorithms for predicting next period returns and measure performance against the market as a benchmark.  \n",

    "<!--To explore sentiment features, quandl provided pre-computed sentiment features that we could conveniently try out. Addeitionally, we wanted to try some basic machine learning algorithms for predicting next period returns. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Skiena et. al. (2010) uses sentiment data to build simple long-short strategies. Skiena’s dataset contains similar information to ours; it uses feature based on “polarity”, how positive or negative the mention is, and volume of news mentions. However, one difference is that Skiena separates information from blogs and news, while our dataset contains all sources together. They find that patterns from opinion in blogs persists longer than from news, which makes sense since opinions are less likely to contain “true” information that will change investors’ investment decisions. This paper provides evidence that sentiment-based investing, which we are analyzing in this write-up, is widespread. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental analysis and investing is a widely-known investing technique that is used in different approaches but is ultimately based on how the company is perfoming as represented by their fundamental financial data. Charles Lee, the Henrietta J. Louis Professor at Cornell University, strives to connect fundamental value and investor sentiment with what is known as \"fusion investing\" in his Fusion Investing paper (2003). Lee states that while \"researchers are finding that even though returns are difficult to predict, prediction is not an impossible task\" and that there are observable systematic patterns in price return series (Lee 2003). While Lee takes the position of observing sentiment value from an investor, our strategy takes the available news sentiment data of the company, and not an individual investor, and attempts to predict performance within those believed systematic patterns."

    "### Creating a Universe of Equities to Use:\n",
    "The idea of using sentiment as a basis for our strategy requires a few different components. First, we would need a universe of equities to use. We also need specific sentiment data for the strategy, end of day data to measure performance, and fundamental financial ratios as a complement to the sentiment data. The fundamental data consists of a set of Zack's files from the Quandl database and both the sentiment data and the end of day data were queried from Quandl using their Quandl API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the fundamental data is from fixed csv files, which can be found in [Quandl's Zacks Collection B database](https://www.quandl.com/databases/ZFB/data \"Quandl Zacks\"), that's where the universe of equities started. The fundamental dataset consists of **9107** unique tickers which established the foundation for our universe. The fundamental dataset contains the following columns as features: *Weighted Average Shares Outstanding, Current Ratio, Gross Margin, Operating Profit Margin, EBIT Margin, Pretax Profit Margin, Profit Margin, Free Cash Flow, Asset Turnover, Inventory Turover, Receivables Turnover, Days Sales in Receivables, Return on Equity, Return on Tangible Equity, Return on Assets, Return on Investments, Free Cash Flow Per Share, Book Value Per Share, and Operating Cash Flow Per Share.*\n",
    "\n",
    "With the understanding that end of day data would be a bit easier to find than sentiment, we queried [quandl's sentiment database](https://www.quandl.com/data/NS1-FinSentS-Web-News-Sentiment \"Quandl FinSent\") with the **9107** tickers. The database consists of 5 different sentiment features: *Sentiment, Sentiment High, Sentiment Low, News Volume,* and *News Buzz*. \n",
    "   - The *Sentiment* feature is a numeric measure of the bullishness / bearishness of news coverage of the stock.\n",
    "   - The *Sentiment High/Low* feature is the highest and lowest intraday sentiment scores.\n",
    "   - The *News Volume* feature is the absolute number of news articles covering the stock.\n",
    "   - The *News Buzz* feature is a numeric measure of the change in coverage volume for the stock.\n",
    "   \n",
    "We found that after filtering out the tickers that were not present in the database and handling any errors and data quality issues, such as missing data, the sentiment dataset held **4753** unique tickers with the 5 different feature sets. \n",

    "After examining the three unique datasets, the selection of tickers to use for the merging of the three datasets came from the database with the smallest number of tickers: the end of day data. \n",

    "This is a long-only equity strategy with monthly frequency. The equities for the given month are selected based on their predicted probability of having positive returns in the next month. The probability is predicted using three models averaged together:\n",

    "The models are selected using grid-search for logistic and gradient boosting, and using default values for the LSTM. The LSTM uses time windows of length (i.e. predicting next-month's return sign using the prior 3 months' values). The LSTM could be futher optimized to possibly get better performance.\n",

The orange line has an upward trend and a sharp dip at the end. This suggests some optimism, but so does the market returns. Also, there is concern from the large concern for the sudden drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large drop comes from large a net short position in the market moving against us\n",
    "* The drop is due to large net short position in the market that happends to turn against us. This large short position comes from an unusually large individual beta. The large net short position (from one stock with unusually large beta) is not unique, but the adverse price change while holding the large position is unique. There are other periods where we hold large short market positions, but the price doesn't move so badly in those periods. In February and March, it does hurt us.\n",

It's difficult to predict when the market will move against us, so instead we will cap our short positions so that markets drops don't hurt as much (_favorable_ market moves will also help us less under capping. It limits both downside and upside).\n",
    "* We now apply a hard cap to the short market positions that we are taking. The betas of any given stock in any prior month are generally less than 5, but sometimes larger 10 or even 30. The strategy runs above used a cap of 10, so now we tighten the cap to 5 (applied as absolute value of 5), and 1, to see if we can soften that large drop."
